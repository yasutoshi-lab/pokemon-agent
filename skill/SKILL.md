# Pokémon Player Skill

Play Pokémon games autonomously via headless emulation. Uses the `pokemon-agent`
package to run a game server, then interacts via HTTP API.

## Setup (First Time Only)

```bash
# Install the package + emulator + dashboard
pip install pokemon-agent[dashboard] pyboy

# User must provide their own ROM file
# The agent CANNOT download or distribute ROMs
```

Ask the user for the ROM file path if not provided. Common locations:
- `~/roms/pokemon_red.gb`
- `~/pokemon_red.gb`

## Starting a Game

```bash
# Start the game server as a background process
pokemon-agent serve --rom <ROM_PATH> --port 8765 &

# Verify it's running
curl -s http://localhost:8765/health
```

Tell the user: "Dashboard available at http://localhost:8765/dashboard"

## Navigation — Use the Collision Map (most important)

The single biggest mistake an agent makes is guessing walkability from raw
pixels and getting lost. Don't. The server reads the game's own collision
data from RAM and hands you a ground-truth map.

```bash
# ASCII walkability map of the current screen (text — cheap + exact)
curl -s http://localhost:8765/map/ascii
```

```
   A B C D E F G H I J
 1 # # # # . . . . . .
 2 # # # # # . # # # .
 3 . . . . . . . . . .
 4 . . . . . . . . . .
 5 . . . . @ . . . . .   <- you are ALWAYS at E5
 6 # # # # # # # # # #
 7 . . . # . . . . . #

@ you (E5)   . walkable   # blocked
up=row-1 down=row+1 left=col-1 right=col+1
```

- Columns are A–J (left→right), rows 1–9 (top→bottom). You are **always** in
  cell **E5** (the screen scrolls around you).
- `.` = you can step there, `#` = blocked (tree/fence/wall/water/sign).
- To plan a move: count cells from E5. Target G6? That's right-2, down-1 —
  but only if every cell on the path is `.`.
- This map is also embedded in `/state` under `collision` (`walkable` grid +
  `ascii` string + `player_cell`).

Use the **ASCII map to decide WHERE to walk**; use a **screenshot to identify
WHAT things are** (NPCs, signs, doors, the Mart's blue roof, the Center's red
roof). They complement each other — RAM gives geometry, vision gives meaning.

```bash
# Screenshot WITH the labelled grid + green/red walkability tint drawn on it
curl -s "http://localhost:8765/screenshot/grid?scale=4" -o /tmp/pkm_grid.png
# then: vision_analyze on /tmp/pkm_grid.png, referencing cells like "what is at H4?"
```

## Narrate to the dashboard (makes the stream come alive)

Push your reasoning so viewers (and you) can follow the run. Display-only —
these are NOT stored in conversation history, so they're free to use often.

```bash
B=http://localhost:8765
curl -s -X POST $B/event -d '{"type":"reasoning","text":"At E5, fence blocks south; gap at G6. Heading there."}'
curl -s -X POST $B/event -d '{"type":"decision","text":"Walk right 2 to G5, then down through G6."}'
curl -s -X POST $B/event -d '{"type":"key_moment","description":"Reached Pewter City","category":"milestone"}'
# categories: milestone | badge | catch | alert
```

A good rhythm each turn: post a short `reasoning` (what the map/screen shows),
then a `decision` (the move you'll make), then send the action.

## Gameplay Loop

Each turn, follow this cycle:

### 1. Observe — Read Game State + Map

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8765/state | python3 -m json.tool
curl -s http://localhost:8765/map/ascii          # walkability — read this every turn
```

Parse the JSON to understand:
- Where am I? (map name, position, `collision.player_cell` = always E5)
- Where can I walk? (`collision.ascii` / `/map/ascii` — `.` walkable, `#` blocked)
- What's happening? (overworld, battle, dialog, menu)
- Party status? (HP, levels, any fainted?)
- Bag contents? (potions, pokeballs?)
- Badges earned?

### 2. Decide — What To Do

**Priority order:**
1. If in dialog → press A to advance (`a_until_dialog_end`)
2. If in battle → choose best move (see Battle Strategy)
3. If party needs healing → navigate to Pokémon Center
4. If ready for next gym → navigate toward it
5. Otherwise → explore, train, catch Pokémon

Use Hermes memory to track:
- Current objective: `PKM:OBJECTIVE: Defeat Brock in Pewter City`
- Map knowledge: `PKM:MAP: Viridian Forest has bug catchers, exit north to Pewter`
- Strategy notes: `PKM:STRATEGY: Brock's Onix is weak to Water — use Bubble`

### 3. Act — Send Commands

```bash
# Single action
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8765/action \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"actions": ["press_a"]}'

# Movement sequence
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8765/action \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"actions": ["walk_up", "walk_up", "walk_right", "press_a"]}'

# Advance dialog
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8765/action \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"actions": ["a_until_dialog_end"]}'
```

### 4. Verify — Check Result

After each action, the response includes `state_after`. Check:
- Did I move? (position changed)
- Did the dialog advance? (new text or cleared)
- Did the battle state change? (HP, turn)

If stuck (same state after 3+ actions), try:
1. Press B to cancel menus
2. Try different direction
3. Load last save

## Action Reference

| Action | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| `press_a` | Press A (confirm, talk, interact) |
| `press_b` | Press B (cancel, run from battle) |
| `press_start` | Open menu |
| `press_select` | Select button |
| `walk_up/down/left/right` | Walk one tile |
| `wait_60` | Wait ~1 second |
| `a_until_dialog_end` | Mash A until dialog finishes |
| `hold_a_30` | Hold A for 30 frames |

## Battle Strategy (Gen 1)

### Type Effectiveness — Key Matchups
- **Water beats**: Fire, Ground, Rock
- **Fire beats**: Grass, Bug, Ice
- **Grass beats**: Water, Ground, Rock
- **Electric beats**: Water, Flying
- **Ground beats**: Fire, Electric, Rock, Poison
- **Ice beats**: Grass, Ground, Flying, Dragon
- **Fighting beats**: Normal, Rock, Ice
- **Psychic beats**: Fighting, Poison (VERY strong in Gen 1)

### Decision Tree
1. Can I one-shot? → Use strongest super-effective move
2. Am I at type disadvantage? → Switch if possible, or use neutral STAB
3. Is enemy HP high? → Consider stat moves first (Growl, Tail Whip)
4. Should I catch? → Weaken to red HP, use Poké Ball
5. Wild battle, don't need it? → Run (press_b or use "Run" option)

### Gen 1 Quirks
- Special stat is BOTH Special Attack and Special Defense
- Psychic type has NO effective counters (Ghost moves bugged, Bug moves weak)
- Critical hit rate based on Speed stat
- Wrap/Bind/Fire Spin prevent the opponent from acting

## Saving

```bash
# Save before important battles
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8765/save \
  -d '{"name": "before_brock"}'

# Load if things go wrong
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8765/load \
  -d '{"name": "before_brock"}'

# List available saves
curl -s http://localhost:8765/saves
```

Save before: Gym battles, catching rare Pokémon, entering dungeons.

## Progression Milestones

Track these in memory as you complete them:

1. ☐ Get starter Pokémon from Oak
2. ☐ Deliver Oak's Parcel, get Pokédex
3. ☐ Reach Pewter City through Viridian Forest
4. ☐ **Boulder Badge** (Brock — Rock type, use Water/Grass)
5. ☐ Reach Cerulean City via Mt. Moon
6. ☐ **Cascade Badge** (Misty — Water type, use Grass/Electric)
7. ☐ Board SS Anne, get HM01 Cut
8. ☐ **Thunder Badge** (Lt. Surge — Electric, use Ground)
9. ☐ Clear Rock Tunnel to Lavender Town
10. ☐ **Rainbow Badge** (Erika — Grass, use Fire/Ice/Flying)
11. ☐ Clear Team Rocket Hideout, get Silph Scope
12. ☐ **Soul Badge** (Koga — Poison, use Ground/Psychic)
13. ☐ **Marsh Badge** (Sabrina — Psychic, use Bug... but good luck in Gen 1)
14. ☐ **Volcano Badge** (Blaine — Fire, use Water/Ground)
15. ☐ **Earth Badge** (Giovanni — Ground, use Water/Grass/Ice)
16. ☐ Victory Road
17. ☐ Elite Four + Champion

## Memory Conventions

Use these prefixes in Hermes memory for Pokémon-related entries:
- `PKM:OBJECTIVE:` — Current goal
- `PKM:MAP:` — Map/navigation knowledge
- `PKM:STRATEGY:` — Battle/team strategy notes
- `PKM:PROGRESS:` — Milestone completion
- `PKM:STUCK:` — Notes about stuck situations and how they were resolved

## Taking Screenshots

```bash
# Plain frame
curl -s http://localhost:8765/screenshot -o /tmp/pokemon_screen.png
# Frame with the labelled A1..J9 grid + green/red walkability tint (preferred)
curl -s "http://localhost:8765/screenshot/grid?scale=4" -o /tmp/pokemon_grid.png
```

Use `vision_analyze` on the grid screenshot when:
- You need to identify WHAT is on screen (menus, NPCs, signs, building roofs)
- You need to read in-game text that RAM doesn't capture well
- You want to confirm orientation — refer to cells (e.g. "what is at H4?")

Remember: for *where can I move*, the ASCII collision map (`/map/ascii`) is
faster and exact. Reserve vision for *what things are*.

## Stopping

When done playing:
1. Save the game: `curl -X POST localhost:8765/save -d '{"name": "session_end"}'`
2. Kill the background server process
3. Save progress notes to memory
