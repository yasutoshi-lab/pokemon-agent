"""Gen 1 collision-map extraction.

Reads the on-screen background tilemap (``wTileMap`` at 0xC3A0, a 20x18 grid
of 8x8 hardware tile ids) and the current tileset id (``wCurMapTileset`` at
0xD367), then classifies each of the 10x9 walkable *blocks* as walkable or
blocked using the authoritative per-tileset collision lists from the pokered
disassembly (``data/tilesets/collision_tile_ids.asm``).

A Gen 1 overworld "block" is 16x16 px = a 2x2 group of 8x8 tiles. The screen
shows 10 blocks across and 9 down. The player is locked to block (col 4,
row 4) — grid cell "E5". Walkability of a block is decided by its top-left
8x8 tile id, which is what the engine itself checks.

Output grid orientation: ``grid[row][col]`` with row 0 at the top, col 0 at
the left; ``True`` means walkable.
